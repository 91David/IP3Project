# Design
This is the design assets converted from the .psd format to web-usable css.

I have used SCSS for this, it is a css preprocessor that has similar syntax to normal css but with some extra things
such as nesting and variables. I like to use this for all web projects because it speeds things up loads.
## ToDo:
- [x] Brand
- [x] Buttons
- [ ] Headers
- [ ] Navigation
- [x] Palettes
- [ ] Tables
- [ ] Tabs
 
```
